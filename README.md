# n8n Docker Setup

This repo has been setup for the purpose of configuring and using a local [n8n](https://n8n.io) network server. The intention is to learn how to set up an ideal environment to deploy a local but centralized n8n task server for a workgroup.

## Requirements
To use this setup you will need the following:
- Docker - [https://docker.com](https://docker.com)
- SSL Certificates - While not required to get a local server spun up and accessible, it is the most secure. I use self-signed certs generated by my firewall and put them in an `ssl` directory. If you want to know more about SSL self-signed certificates you should check out [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). They are the fastest way to get up and running.

## Create Necessary Directorys
The `docker-compose.yaml` references two directories you will need to create in the root of your project. The first is the `data` directory to store the local data needed keep your saved workflows and identities when working with n8n. 

The second is `local-files` directory. This is where n8n can access or output files needed in workflows.

It is important that these two directories are created in the same root directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file.
